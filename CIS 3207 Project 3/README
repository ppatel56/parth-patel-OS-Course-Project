Project 3 - Network Spell Checker

Description: 

The Network Spell Checker Program is networking program in which multiple clients connect to one server 
and send a string to the server. The server would then process those inputs from the clients and determine 
if each individual string's spelling is "correct" or "incorrect".

Because there are multiple clients connecting to the server and sending their own string, the server needs 
multiple worker threads to help check if the strings are spelled correctly. This way, the user wouldn't have
to wait too long if there was only one thread taking in multiple inputs. The number of worker threads corresponds
to the number of clients in the program, which is four. There is also another thread in the program called the 
log thread which takes the final string message "word is correct(incorrect) spelling" to a log text file.
The final thread is the main thread of the program, or the original thread.

There are two queues used in the program, a connection queue and a log queue. The reason why C++ is used for this project
is because there is a provided queue library in the language. The connection queue is a queue of ints in where all of the
client sockets will be stored. A worker thread will take a client socket and get the string that client sends and checks 
its spelling then stores the message onto the log queue.

Since we're dealing with a multi-threaded program, there will be problems in concurrency. So in order to avoid the
problems such as race condition, the program has locks and conditional variables.
